# MoSim Charged Up

This is a complete overhaul mod of the FRC Crescendo simulator game, made by MO from team 4089, Stealth Robotics.

This mod features the FRC 2023 game, Charged Up, along with 2910, 5940, a complete overhaul of the game's menus, and many other changes.

Both keyboard and controllers are supported, but currently, there is no way to rebind your keybinds (coming soon).
There is also currently no local multiplayer support, however, that will be coming soon along with many other polishing things.

Huge shoutout to Mo for making the original game, and all of those that have supported me in this journey. Ranging from all of the playtesters to the developers already working on mods for this mod, and the massive community support so far. Y'all are amazing.

I hope y'all enjoy the mod and feel free to leave any feedback in the [MoSimulator discord](https://discord.gg/JcrwE45u).

The download link is in the release page.
